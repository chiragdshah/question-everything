## 1. Origin Story

In January 2024, Chirag and Sunay found themselves on the same train to a Knicks game. The conversation turned to their recent rediscoveries — Chirag's pivot through *Stolen Focus*, Daily Stoic, and *Outlive*; Sunay's lifelong fascination with meaning and purpose. Links flew back and forth over email and text. Sunay suggested setting aside time to talk every week. Chirag said, "We should just start a podcast." And here we are.

**How they met:** Chemistry lab at NYU — partnered together because they share the same last name (Shah). Always finished first. Experienced college together — parties, dance clubs, working at Webster Hall, and many late nights trying to figure things out. Friends ever since.

**Chirag's journey:** Born in India, moved to Queens at age 3. Grew up in Flushing and Jamaica (diverse), then suburban upstate NY for high school (not diverse at all). Moving around caused him to retreat into books and music. NYU opened him up. Career path: developer → project/program manager. Went through a personal rut during the pandemic (2019–2022: maybe 5 books total). Then three events in quick succession changed everything: *Stolen Focus*, Ryan Holiday's Daily Stoic, and *Outlive*. Second half of 2023 alone: 12 books. Philosophy, fitness, and intentional living followed.

**Sunay's journey:** Born in NYC (Jackson Heights/Flushing), grew up in suburban New Jersey near Princeton. Not much diversity — got called names that lumped Arabic and Indian stereotypes together. Nerdy, introverted, studious, family-oriented. Couldn't wait to leave suburbia. NYU felt like home. Has been interested in meaning and purpose since childhood — earliest thoughts were about fractals ("Are planets like cells in another gigantic life form?"). Found comfort in feeling like a small, insignificant spec on a predetermined path. Didn't read much philosophy but loved talking about it with anyone who'd engage.

## 2. Mission & Vision

### Core Mission
Deliberate, examine, and explore what a well-lived life consists of across diverse perspectives.

### Core Philosophy
> "An unexamined life is not worth living." — Socrates

Socrates believed that philosophy — the love of wisdom — was the most important pursuit above all else.

Applied, practical philosophy that promotes self-examination on daily decision making towards living a good life. Applying philosophical principles and decision making frameworks to daily life that get at the *why* behind motivations. Our mission is to ask the really deep questions to get to the heart of people's intentions.

Different perspectives looking at the same situation can be completely different — *The Fifth Element* Gary Oldman chaos scene with glass breaking & billionaire claiming to create jobs through private jet.

### Goals
1. Have a blast engaging in thoughtful, intellectual, and philosophical conversations with friends and like-minded people
2. Creation of content that is subscriber worthy on Substack as evidenced by 100 paid subscribers by end of 2026
3. Launch our website, newsletter, and social platform content delivery for every episode we record
4. Create a dashboard that shows our activity and audience engagement across all channels by 1Q 26
5. Establish and hold quarterly retrospectives to continue our evolution as a podcast

### What This Podcast Is About
A long-form conversation series exploring how people make meaning in a world that relentlessly measures success through money, status, and scale. At our core, we remain a philosophy-forward podcast — curious, skeptical, and human. We care about morality, community, purpose, and how individuals decide what a good life actually looks like.

### What's Evolving
Not *what* we question, but *where* we focus that questioning. Increasingly, we are interested in people whose lives challenge the default assumptions about success — not because they are anti-capitalist or anti-ambition, but because they chose to optimize for something else.

---

## 3. The Focused Direction (2026)

### This podcast centers on discovering the true intent behind the choices made and paths taken.

We speak with people about their deliberate choices, exploring the true intent behind their decisions, especially those involving the rejection of conventional paths — be it money, prestige, visibility, or established career ladders — and the acceptance of the resulting tradeoffs. We dig beyond the sound bites and prepared narrative to understand our guests' journey on living a well-lived life.

### We're interested in:
- How meaning is built when applause is absent
- The evolution of the definition of a well-lived life
- What critical decisions, milestones, setbacks, or successes resulted in you re-examining if you are living a well-lived life

### This is not a podcast about heroes, purity, or perfect answers. It's about responsibility, ambiguity, and lived decisions.

### How This Fits the Core
We still "question everything" — but we now do it through *lives*, not abstractions alone. Our conversations continue to explore:

- **Morality:** What obligations do we feel toward others, institutions, and future generations?
- **Community:** How trust, stewardship, and contribution are built locally and quietly
- **Purpose & Meaning:** Not as slogans, but as choices made under real constraints
- **Philosophy in practice:** How values collide with incentives in everyday life

What's different is that we don't stop at ideas. We examine how those ideas show up in actual decisions, with real consequences.

### Why This Matters
In a culture saturated with visible success stories, we believe there is quiet wisdom in the stories that don't scale, don't trend, and don't convert neatly into numbers. By surfacing these perspectives, Question Everything offers listeners something rare:

- New reference points for evaluating their own choices
- Language for tradeoffs they already feel but haven't named
- A more honest conversation about what fulfillment actually costs

**This podcast is for people who sense that the dominant metrics are incomplete — and want to think more carefully about what else might matter.**

## 4. Philosophical Foundation — Podcast Values

### Socratic Tradition
We follow Socrates' belief that philosophy — the love of wisdom — was the most important pursuit. Our conversations explore fundamental questions about how to live, what gives life meaning, and what truth we can find through dialogue.

### Evergreen Over Timely
We avoid current politics and aim for timeless relevance. Even when discussing contemporary issues (social media, democracy, technology), we frame them through philosophical questions that will matter in 10, 50, or 100 years.

### Exploratory, Not Prescriptive
We're searching for truth, meaning, and purpose — not claiming to have found them. Every episode is an exploration, not a conclusion.

### Evergreen Framing Examples

| Instead of... | Frame as... |
|---------------|-------------|
| "Social media is destroying democracy" | "How does the way we communicate shape our ability to seek truth together?" |
| "Political polarization in 2024" | "Why is it so hard to talk across our differences?" |
| "The problem with modern capitalism" | "What's the relationship between competition, community, and human flourishing?" |

**The test:** Will this question matter in 50 years? If yes, it's evergreen. If it references specific politicians, elections, or news cycles, reframe it.

## 5. Brand Voice

### Core Principles

**Intellectually Curious, Not Pretentious** — We explore complex ideas but make them accessible. Use relatable metaphors (like chocolate cake vs. vegetables) to ground abstract concepts.

**Honest About Uncertainty** — We don't claim to have all the answers. "We don't have all the answers (who does?)" shows intellectual humility.

**Conversational and Personal** — Write like you're talking to a friend over dinner. Contractions, parenthetical asides, authentic language. Personal anecdotes add warmth.

**Questioning, Not Preachy** — End with genuine questions that invite reflection. "Can we talk our way out of this mess?" beats "We must talk our way out of this mess."

**Substantive but Accessible** — Tackle serious topics but avoid academic jargon. Find the everyday angle.

### What Works
- Relatable metaphors that make abstract ideas concrete
- Personal reflection mixed with big ideas
- Questions that genuinely invite engagement
- Acknowledging complexity rather than oversimplifying
- Teasing interesting angles without spoiling the conversation
- Balance of serious + lighter touches
- Specific examples that ground broad themes
- Philosophical framing over political framing
- Timeless questions over current events

### What Doesn't Work
- Clickbait sensationalism ("You won't BELIEVE...")
- Being preachy or prescriptive ("Here's what YOU need to do")
- Over-promising conclusions ("We SOLVE democracy!")
- Academic jargon without translation
- Too much plot summary
- Desperation for engagement ("Please like and share!!!")
- Fake controversy or manufactured urgency
- Political framing or partisan language
- References to current political figures or events
- Time-bound references that will feel dated

### Tone Calibration
- **Think of it as:** A dinner conversation that happened to tackle democracy
- **Not:** An academic lecture or political manifesto
- **The sweet spot:** Smart enough to respect the audience, accessible enough to invite them in
- **The test:** Would you actually say this out loud to a friend? If not, revise it.

## 7. Guest Philosophy

### What Guests Can Expect
A thoughtful, respectful — but probing — conversation. We are less interested in résumés, advice, or optimization frameworks, and more interested in questions guests may not have been asked before:

- What success would have looked like if you'd chosen the obvious path
- What you had to give up that still feels unresolved
- Where money, status, or recognition still exert pull
- What parts of your work matter deeply but go unnoticed
- How your sense of meaning has changed over time — not just improved
- How have your motivations changed over time — why
- Who has had the most influence in your motivations and definition of a life well-lived
- If you had no limitations or restrictions what would you do with your time

Our aim is not to put guests on a pedestal, but to invite reflection — often alongside the audience — on how lives are shaped by what we choose to value.

**Short Description:**
> Social media, political tribalism, and clickbait culture are reshaping our democracy — and what we can do about it. From chocolate cake metaphors to deep debates on free speech, capitalism, and civic life, Chirag and Sunay explore why civil discourse feels broken, and how long-form conversations (like this one) might just be the antidote.

**LinkedIn Company:**
> We're living in an age of tweets, tribes, and clickbait — and it's taking a toll on democracy. In our latest episode, we dig into why civil discourse feels broken, how social media fuels division, and why long-form conversations might just be the antidote. If you've ever wondered whether we can talk our way out of this mess, this one's for you.

**LinkedIn Personal:**
> Sometimes the best conversations start over dinner and end up spiraling into democracy, free speech, capitalism, and even chocolate cake metaphors. In our latest episode, Sunay and I wrestle with the trouble of truth in an age of tweets, tribes, and algorithms. We don't have all the answers (who does?), but we believe that civil discourse — real, thoughtful conversation — is the only way forward.
