# Question Everything (Except This Podcast!) - Brand Guide

## Show Identity

**Format**: Conversational, long-form dialogue exploring big ideas  
**Episode Length**: 40-60 minutes  
**Hosts**: Chirag and Sunay  
**Mission**: Philosophy of life - examining purpose, meaning, and truth through Socratic dialogue  
**Core Philosophy**: "An unexamined life is not worth living." –Socrates  
**Topics**: Philosophy, meaning, purpose, human nature, ethics, society - examined as timeless questions, not current events  
**Target Audience**: Thoughtful listeners who crave philosophical depth over hot takes or political punditry

## Philosophical Foundation

**Socratic Tradition**  
We follow Socrates' belief that philosophy—the love of wisdom—is the most important pursuit. Our conversations explore fundamental questions about how to live, what gives life meaning, and what truth we can find through dialogue.

**Evergreen Over Timely**  
We avoid current politics and aim for timeless relevance. Even when discussing contemporary issues (social media, democracy, technology), we frame them through philosophical questions that will matter in 10, 50, or 100 years.

**Exploratory, Not Prescriptive**  
We're searching for truth, meaning, and purpose—not claiming to have found them. Every episode is an exploration, not a conclusion.

## Brand Voice

### Core Principles

**Intellectually Curious, Not Pretentious**  
We explore complex ideas but make them accessible. Use relatable metaphors (like chocolate cake vs. vegetables) to ground abstract concepts.

**Honest About Uncertainty**  
We don't claim to have all the answers. Phrases like "We don't have all the answers (who does?)" or "We're wrestling with..." show intellectual humility.

**Conversational and Personal**  
Write like you're talking to a friend over dinner. Use contractions, parenthetical asides, and authentic language. Personal anecdotes (like "this conversation started over dinner") add warmth.

**Questioning, Not Preachy**  
End with genuine questions that invite reflection, not rhetorical proclamations. "Can we talk our way out of this mess?" beats "We must talk our way out of this mess."

**Substantive but Accessible**  
Tackle serious topics but avoid academic jargon. If a concept needs explanation, find the everyday angle.

### What Works

✅ Relatable metaphors that make abstract ideas concrete  
✅ Personal reflection mixed with big ideas  
✅ Questions that genuinely invite engagement  
✅ Acknowledging complexity rather than oversimplifying  
✅ Teasing interesting angles without spoiling the conversation  
✅ Balance of serious + lighter touches  
✅ Specific examples that ground broad themes  
✅ Philosophical framing over political framing  
✅ Timeless questions over current events

### What Doesn't Work

❌ Clickbait sensationalism ("You won't BELIEVE what we discovered!")  
❌ Being preachy or prescriptive ("Here's what YOU need to do")  
❌ Over-promising conclusions ("We SOLVE democracy!")  
❌ Academic jargon without translation  
❌ Too much plot summary (let them discover the conversation)  
❌ Desperation for engagement ("Please like and share!!!")  
❌ Fake controversy or manufactured urgency  
❌ Political framing or partisan language  
❌ References to current political figures or events (unless unavoidable)  
❌ Time-bound references that will feel dated

## Evergreen Framing

When episodes touch on contemporary issues, always elevate to the philosophical level:

**Instead of**: "Social media is destroying democracy"  
**Frame as**: "How does the way we communicate shape our ability to seek truth together?"

**Instead of**: "Political polarization in 2024"  
**Frame as**: "Why is it so hard to talk across our differences?"

**Instead of**: "The problem with modern capitalism"  
**Frame as**: "What's the relationship between competition, community, and human flourishing?"

The test: **Will this question matter in 50 years?** If yes, it's evergreen. If it references specific politicians, elections, or news cycles, reframe it.

## Proven Examples

### Episode Description (Podcast Page)

**Example:**
> Social media, political tribalism, and clickbait culture are reshaping our democracy—and what we can do about it. From chocolate cake metaphors to deep debates on free speech, capitalism, and civic life, Chirag and Sunay explore why civil discourse feels broken, and how long-form conversations (like this one) might just be the antidote.

**Why it works:**
- Opens with the big problem
- Teases specific moments (chocolate cake metaphor) without explaining them
- Positions the podcast as part of the solution
- 2-3 sentences, ~150 characters
- **Evergreen framing**: Focuses on "civil discourse" and "how we talk" (timeless) rather than specific political events or figures (time-bound)

### Website Description

**Example:**
> Why does civil discourse feel so broken—and can long-form conversations help bring it back? In this episode, we explore how social media, tribalism, and clickbait culture have reshaped democracy, and why balance, dignity, and community might be the missing ingredients.
>
> From Sunay's reflections on the Baha'i faith to Chirag's take on social media's role in eroding trust, we tackle free speech, capitalism, competition, and the tricky line between platforming ideas and spreading misinformation. Along the way, we revisit the chocolate cake vs. vegetables metaphor (you'll see why) and ask whether podcasts are part of the solution or part of the problem.
>
> Our takeaway: civil discourse may not fix everything, but it's a start—and the only way forward is to keep talking, especially with those we disagree with.

**Why it works:**
- Opens with a question
- Three clear paragraphs: hook → details → takeaway
- Name-drops specific perspectives from each host
- Teases interesting moments ("you'll see why")
- Ends with the core philosophy
- 400-600 words

### LinkedIn Post (Company Page)

**Example:**
> We're living in an age of tweets, tribes, and clickbait—and it's taking a toll on democracy. In our latest episode, we dig into why civil discourse feels broken, how social media fuels division, and why long-form conversations might just be the antidote. If you've ever wondered whether we can talk our way out of this mess, this one's for you.

**Why it works:**
- Punchy opening that names the problem
- Clear setup of what the episode explores
- Ends with a question and invitation
- Conversational ("this one's for you")
- ~60-80 words

### LinkedIn Post (Personal/Repost)

**Example:**
> Sometimes the best conversations start over dinner and end up spiraling into democracy, free speech, capitalism, and even chocolate cake metaphors. In our latest episode, Sunay and I wrestle with the trouble of truth in an age of tweets, tribes, and algorithms. We don't have all the answers (who does?), but we believe that civil discourse—real, thoughtful conversation—is the only way forward. Would love for you to give it a listen and share your thoughts. What do you think—can we still talk our way back to a healthier democracy?

**Why it works:**
- Personal anecdote opens it warmly
- Names both hosts
- Shows intellectual humility
- Genuine invitation for dialogue
- Ends with an open question
- ~80-100 words

## Tone Calibration

**Think of it as**: A dinner conversation that happened to tackle democracy  
**Not**: An academic lecture or political manifesto

**The sweet spot**: Smart enough to respect the audience, accessible enough to invite them in

**The test**: Would you actually say this out loud to a friend? If not, revise it.
