Create a podcast episode thumbnail image, 1920x1080 pixels (16:9 landscape format).

Background scene: Two weathered wooden chairs facing each other on a rocky mountain overlook at dawn, a vast valley of fog rolling beneath them.

Background scene: A busy city intersection at night, shot from slightly above street level. Hundreds of glowing screens — billboards, phone screens, digital displays — compete for attention in every direction, their light washing the scene in blue and white. In the center of the frame, a single figure stands still on the crosswalk, looking up at the night sky while the world of screens swirls around them.

In the middle distance, a lone concrete watchtower or bunker stands silhouetted against a heavy, dramatic sky. The sky is layered with deep oranges, reds, and dark purples as the sun sets behind thick clouds. The landscape feels post-apocalyptic in its emptiness and stillness.

At the far end, a figure sits alone, the cool blue twilight reflecting off the water around them.

A sense of distance and quiet separation. Cinematic photography style, slightly desaturated to feel editorial and premium.

A few newspapers have blown onto the sidewalk. Behind the stand, the blurry glow of a large digital billboard casts cool blue light, contrasting with the warm wood and paper of the stand. The scene feels like a moment caught between eras. Warm golden tones on the physical newspapers, cool digital blue from the billboard behind.

Background scene: A dimly lit university lecture hall, shot from the back row looking down toward the front. A large green chalkboard dominates the front wall, covered in a chaotic mix of mathematical equations — some elegantly written, others scrawled and crossed out, circles and arrows connecting ideas. A single desk lamp illuminates the board from below, casting dramatic upward shadows. Chalk dust hangs in the air. The mood is intense and slightly surreal. Warm amber from the desk lamp against the cool dark green of the chalkboard. Cinematic photography style, slightly desaturated to feel editorial and premium.

Fallen autumn leaves gather around the bench legs. The park is empty — no people visible anywhere. A single old-fashioned street lamp near the bench casts a warm amber pool of light in the gathering blue twilight. The contrast between the intimate warmth of the lamp and the vast emptiness of the park creates a poignant sense of solitude.

Background scene: A desolate crossroads on a rural two-lane highway at twilight, shot from ground level at the center of the intersection. The two roads stretch in four directions toward distant horizons. A weathered road sign stands at the junction, its text illegible. Storm clouds gather on one horizon while the other shows a sliver of clear sky with warm amber light breaking through. Power lines run along one road, disappearing into the distance. The mood is tense and uncertain — a decision point. Cool blue-grey storm tones clash with warm amber light. Cinematic photography style, slightly desaturated to feel editorial and premium.

Through the door, a wild, overgrown meadow bursts with untamed wildflowers and tall grass swaying in the wind, bathed in warm late-afternoon golden light. The interior side of the frame is clean, sterile, and cool-toned — a perfectly organized but empty room. The contrast between the controlled interior and the chaotic, beautiful exterior is the tension. Dramatic golden hour warmth flooding through the doorway, cool neutral tones inside. Cinematic photography style, slightly desaturated to feel editorial and premium.

Create a podcast episode thumbnail image, 1920x1080 pixels (16:9 landscape format).

Late afternoon sunlight streams through tall arched windows, casting long golden shafts of light across the marble floor. The architecture is timeless and dignified. Dust motes float in the light beams. The feeling is of weight, motion, and endurance — cycles that continue. Warm amber sunlight against cool grey-white marble.

A brass mortar and pestle sits on the worn wooden counter in the foreground. A single warm light source from the left illuminates the glass bottles, creating rich reflections and deep shadows. The shelves stretch into soft-focus darkness on the right. The mood is reverent and weighty — the beauty and burden of healing. Warm amber and deep shadow tones.

Background scene: A charming small-town main street in winter, shot from the middle of the road looking toward a prominent clock tower. The clock reads 6:00. Light snow falls, and the same set of footprints appears multiple times on the snowy sidewalk — walking in the same direction, slightly offset, as if someone has walked the same path again and again. Warm amber light spills from storefronts onto the snow. The sky is that pre-dawn blue-grey of early morning. The mood is eerie but beautiful — the uncanny feeling of repetition.

## Episode #23 — "TRIBES, TWEETS, AND THE TROUBLE WITH TRUTH"

Create a podcast episode thumbnail image, 1920x1080 pixels (16:9 landscape format).

Background scene: The interior of a classic American town hall, shot from the center aisle looking toward a wooden podium at the front. The room is divided — the left side lit in warm amber from tall windows, the right side in cooler shadow. A sharp line of light cuts diagonally across the floor between the two sides. Rows of empty wooden chairs face the podium on both sides. An American flag hangs behind the podium, partially in light, partially in shadow. The mood is divided but dignified — the tension of democracy in action. Warm amber against cool grey-blue shadow. Cinematic photography style, slightly desaturated to feel editorial and premium.

Layout and text:

The left two-thirds of the image is the scenic background, slightly darkened for contrast

A subtle dark gradient overlay covers the bottom third of the image

In the bottom-left corner, place the attached logo (the orange microphone ?E! PODCAST logo) at about 15% of the image height

To the right of the logo, display the episode title "TRIBES, TWEETS, AND THE TROUBLE WITH TRUTH" in clean white sans-serif bold text, all caps

Keep the right side of the image more open to let the hall breathe

Style notes: The overall feel should be cinematic and contemplative — not busy. The orange in the logo should feel like it belongs with the warm amber window light cutting across the town hall. Keep it clean and minimal. This should read clearly as a thumbnail even at small sizes.

## Episode #24 — "WHY KNOWING YOURSELF MATTERS" | with Suneet Bhatt

Create a podcast episode thumbnail image, 1920x1080 pixels (16:9 landscape format).

Background scene: A tall corporate ladder leaning against a plain concrete wall, shot from ground level. But the scene's focus is to the left — a figure walking away from the ladder through an open gate into a vast, open landscape of rolling fields leading to distant mountains. The figure is small but purposeful, heading toward the horizon. Behind them, the ladder casts a long shadow. Late afternoon golden hour light illuminates the open field, while the wall and ladder remain in cooler shadow. The mood is liberation — choosing your own path. Warm golden field light against cool concrete grey. Cinematic photography style, slightly desaturated to feel editorial and premium.

Style notes: The overall feel should be cinematic and contemplative — not busy. The orange in the logo should feel like it belongs with the warm golden hour light on the open field. Keep it clean and minimal. This should read clearly as a thumbnail even at small sizes.

## Episode #25 — "THE JOURNEY TO YOURSELF" | with Ruth Pearce

Create a podcast episode thumbnail image, 1920x1080 pixels (16:9 landscape format).

Background scene: A theater dressing room, shot from slightly above. A row of masks — dramatic, comedic, neutral — hang on hooks along a worn brick wall. Below them, a single wooden chair faces a large mirror surrounded by warm vanity bulbs. The mirror reflects the empty chair and the masks behind it. One mask has fallen to the floor. The lighting is intimate — the vanity bulbs cast warm, honest light while the rest of the room fades into shadow. The mood is vulnerable and transformative — the moment between performances when you're just yourself. Warm vanity-bulb amber against dark theatrical shadows. Cinematic photography style, slightly desaturated to feel editorial and premium.
